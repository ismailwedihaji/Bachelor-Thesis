This thesis explores the application of machine learning techniques within the financial technology sector, specifically targeting the prediction of the S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 is a key indicator of the US economy which reflects the stock performance of 500 major companies.

Traditional statistical methods for predicting stock market trends often struggle with the volatility and complexity of financial markets. Our research aims to fill this gap by comparing the effectiveness of various machine learning models which are Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term movements of the S&P 500 index.

The significance of this problem lies in the growing reliance on ML models by financial companies to inform investment strategies. The study uses historical S&P 500 data from 1995 to 2024, retrieved from Yahoo Finance, focusing on metrics such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume prices. The data was preprocessed to ensure consistency and was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the models.

Our results show that the Polynomial Regression and Decision Tree models performed well on the training data but they had significant errors on the testing data. While, the LSTM model showed better performance, effectively capturing both short-term and long-term market trends. Based on these findings results, suggest that LSTM networks provide the most reliable predictions.
